# Lucy Mendez's Contribution

This directory contains code and artifacts related to Lucy's work on the project, primarily focusing on the EfficientNet deep learning model and associated data processing and visualization.

## Key Components

*   **Deep Learning Model:**
    *   `efficientnetv2_model_3classes.py`: Contains the implementation, training, and potentially evaluation logic for the **EfficientNetV2 model** adapted for the 3-class Alzheimer's detection task.

*   **Data Processing:**
    *   Code related to preprocessing, data augmentation, and exploration of MRI slices, likely integrated within the `efficientnetv2_model_3classes.py` script or potentially helper scripts not listed.

*   **Results & Visualizations:**
    *   `training_curves.png`: Plot showing model training/validation loss and accuracy over epochs.
    *   `sensitivity_specificity.png`: Plot visualizing the sensitivity and specificity trade-offs (potentially related to ROC or similar analysis).
    *   `saliency_maps.png`: Visualizations highlighting the input image regions most influential for the model's predictions.
    *   `roc_curves.png`: ROC curve plot for the EfficientNetV2 model.
    *   `confusion_matrix.png`: Confusion matrix showing the model's classification performance.
    *   `brain_slice_samples.png`: Example images of brain slices used.
    *   `3d_brain_visualization_fixed.png`: A 3D visualization related to the brain data or model.
