# Vetrivel Kanakasabai's Contribution

This directory contains notebooks, scripts, and artifacts related to Vetrivel's exploration of the ConvMixer model and initial data checks for the project.

## Key Components

*   **Deep Learning Model Exploration:**
    *   `ConvMixer.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation, training, and analysis of the **ConvMixer model** for Alzheimer's detection.

*   **Data Analysis & Preprocessing:**
    *   `data_check.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used for initial data checks, exploration of MRI scan slices, and potentially preprocessing steps.

*   **Results & Visualizations:**
    *   `loss_acc_convmixer.png`: Plot showing the training/validation loss and accuracy curves for the ConvMixer model.
    *   `confmat_convmixer.png`: Confusion matrix illustrating the classification performance of the ConvMixer model.
    *   `OAS1_0001_MR1_mpr_n4_anon_111_t88_masked_gfc_all_slices.jpg`: An example image file, likely used during exploration or as input/output visualization.
