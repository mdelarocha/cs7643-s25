# Kaitlin Timmer's Contribution

This directory contains code and artifacts related to Kaitlin's work on the project, focusing on data handling, preprocessing, visualization, and the ResNeXt deep learning model.

## Key Components

*   **Data Handling & Preprocessing:**
    *   `data.py`: Contains functions/classes for loading MRI data. This likely includes preprocessing steps such as data augmentation and the implementation of **Otsu's method** for thresholding/segmentation.
    *   `data_exploration.py`: Scripts used for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) and potentially visualizing the raw or preprocessed MRI scans.

*   **Deep Learning Model:**
    *   Implementation and training code for the **ResNeXt model**, also included within `data.py`.

*   **Visualization:**
    *   Code within `data_exploration.py`, as well as `data.py` or other scripts for visualizing MRI scans.

Refer to the main project `README.md` for a summary of Kaitlin's overall contributions.
